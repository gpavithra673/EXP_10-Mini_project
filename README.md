# EXP_10-Mini_project
## AIM:
To create a complete Battleship game with an AI opponent using Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) for decision-making in Pygame is quite involved. Below is a simplified version of the game, where the AI uses Monte Carlo Simulation to make guesses about the playerâ€™s ship locations.
## Description of game:
### Game Titel: Battleship with Top Gun
The player places their ships on a grid.
The AI tries to guess where the ships are using Monte Carlo Simulation, which means it runs several random simulations to determine the most likely spots for the ships.
The game runs using Pygame for the GUI and controls.
## Algorithm:
Step 1: Random Sampling is done inorder to run simulations using random inputs to model possible outcomes.

Step 2: Multiple Iterations is repeated many times (e.g., 1000+ iterations) to explore a wide range of scenarios.

Step 3: The results of each iteration are collected and analyzed.

Step 4: Probability Estimation will calculate the likelihood of different outcomes by comparing the frequency of results across iterations.

Step 5: Decision making is done based on the most frequent or highest-scoring outcomes, decisions or predictions are made.

Step 6: The more simulations run, the more accurate the probability estimates become.
